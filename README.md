# Jagdzeit


Portfoliopage

The central idea was to have the content on one page without reloading the page or replacing elements. Instead the elements change into the needed elements. The whole content is on the main page. It boroughs familiar design concepts from Google 'Material' and Mircosoft 'Metro/Modern' Design.
It is designed for desktop browsers in mind. Responsiveness might be added in the feature.

Technologies: SASS, jQuery JavaScript
No Framework has been used.
